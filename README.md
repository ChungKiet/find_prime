## Prime Number Finder with Concurrency

This Go program efficiently finds all prime numbers between 1 and 100,000 using **Goroutines** and **Channels** 
to parallelize the computation. It demonstrates the use of the **worker pool pattern** in Go to distribute
tasks across multiple workers and collect results concurrently.

### Features
1. **Concurrency:**
    - Utilizes a pool of 4 workers to perform prime number calculations concurrently.
    - Uses `sync.WaitGroup` to synchronize worker completion.

2. **Progress Monitoring:**
    - Logs the progress of task processing periodically.

3. **Result Collection:**
    - Collects prime numbers into a shared slice.
    - Sorts the results before displaying them.

4. **Performance:**
    - Optimized prime-checking function using the square root method.
    - Buffered channels for efficient communication between workers.

### Code Overview

- **Task Channel:** Contains numbers to be checked for primality.
- **Results Channel:** Stores numbers identified as prime.
- **Workers:** Each worker pulls numbers from the task channel, checks if they're prime,
and sends primes to the results channel.
